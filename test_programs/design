1. The server receives the initial connection. accept()
2. Inspect the source port of the connection request --> Use this to determine what port to connect to on the 'internal' host.
3. Create the connection to the internal host from the port forwarder host.
4. Create 2 threads which wait on both sockets -->
    When the external socket gets data it needs to go to the internal host through the internal socket.
    When the internal socket gets data it needs to go to the external host through the external socket.
    Just make sure to put something in place so that sockets don't try to get accessed at the exact same time. Lock, or something else.
5. Once those threads are started, go back to the main loop which will start from step 1 and wait for a new connection.
